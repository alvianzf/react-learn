                            Gojekâ€™s journey began in 2010 as a motorcycle ride-hailing call center in Indonesia. The homegrown app was then launched in 2015 with only three services: GoRide, GoSend, and GoMart.

                            Since then, the app has evolved into a Super App, a multi-services platform with more than 20 services today.

                            Gojek is now a leading technology group of platform serving millions of users in Southeast Asia.
